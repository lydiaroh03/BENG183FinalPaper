## 01 Abstract<a name="011"></a>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized genomics research. This technology generates massive datasets that require tools for efficient analysis and visualization. deepTools is a collective bioinformatics tool designed to address these challenges, particularly for epigenomics and transcriptomics studies. This paper provides an in-depth overview of deepTools, its key features, and its application in workflows. With its ability to streamline the processing of genome-wide coverage files and generate high-quality visualizations, deepTools is a useful resource for researchers to navigate the complexities of high-throughput sequencing data.

## 02 Introduction<a name="211"></a>

deepTools is essentially a collection of tools, used primarily in the Bioinformatics field, designed for analysis and visualization of data obtained from Next Generation Sequencing Technologies[Chip-Seq, RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq]. It is useful in the way that the design of the toolkit allows for it to handle large datasets, making it easier for researchers to use for processing, quality control as well as visualization purposes.
