## Introduction<a name="111"></a>

deepTools is essentially a collection of tools, used primarily in the Bioinformatics field, designed for analysis and visualization of data obtained from Next Generation Sequencing Technologies[Chip-Seq, RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq]. It is useful in the way that the design of the toolkit allows for it to handle large datasets, making it easier for researchers to use for processing, quality control as well as visualization purposes.
